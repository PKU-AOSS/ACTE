# ACTE
The Adaptive Convolutional Tree Ensemble (ACTE) model combines the advantages of convolutional neural networks and tree-based models, effectively integrating prior empirical feature parameters to achieve high-precision predictions for different VOCs with maximum adaptability.

Please note that when using this model, you should convert the data file into a pandas DataFrame format and split the feature variables and target variable into two separate DataFrames.

If you encounter any issues, please feel free to reach out to me via ResearchGate (https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yong-Cheng-14). I regularly check messages and will respond promptly.
